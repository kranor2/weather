# Weather App

## Description
This is my seventh project within the Full Stack JavaScript course from The Odin Project, continuing my coursework within the JavaScript chapter of the course. In this prompt response, i have built a web application which produces a 3-day weather forecast, fetching and using data from WeatherAPI based on the value typed into the search bar by the user. In this project, I've continued to practice skills with webpack, including refreshing my memory on using a template repository. In tandem with implementing learnings on APIs and how they interact with web applications in JavaScript, this project enabled me to test out my skills with fetch calls, asynchronous functions (using async/await, try/catch error handling) and promises, and parsing/displaying JSON data within a GUI.

As I have in previous projects, I did work to continue honing both learned and new CSS skills; this includes practicing implementation of absolute and relative position, the transform property, and relative units. Admittedly, however, styling was not a priority in this project: this is not my most visually or aesthetically perfect project (let alone a responsive project). My priority focus was more to practice skills focused on the functionality of the project instead.
